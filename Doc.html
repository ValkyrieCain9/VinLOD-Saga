        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p> This project was developed for the <i>Information Science and Cultural Heritage</i> exam within the
            University of Bologna's Master's degree program in <i>Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge</i>. Its core
            purpose is to <b>semantically link 10 cultural heritage objects on the web using RDF</b>, with the
            overarching goal of <b>contributing to the preservation and enhanced accessibility of cultural heritage</b>.
        </p>
        <p> Our workflow began with the <b>selection of objects inspired by the anime and manga Vinland Saga</b>. Each
            chosen item was then organized and interlinked within a <b>conceptual map</b> in order to visually highlight
            the <b>entity relationships</b> between the selected items.</p>
        <p> Subsequently, all associated information (including <b>textual transcriptions in XML/TEI</b>) was captured
            using <b>appropriate standard metadata</b> and converted into <b>RDF (<i>Resource Description
                    Framework</i>)</b>, a machine-readable and interoperable format.</p>
        <p> The entire process allowed us to <b>establish robust semantic connections</b> between the objects, their
            descriptions and their contexts, thereby enriching the <b>digital landscape of cultural heritage</b>, with
            the scope of <b>ensuring its longevity and discoverability</b> for future students and users.</p>
        <h3 id="mapping">Mapping the Items</h3>
        <p>The items were selected through different forms of linkage:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>narrative connections</b>, established through historical figures, objects and events depicted in the
                storyline of the anime and the manga items;</li>
            <li><b>item-level relationships</b>, involving objects directly related to the primary item, such as the
                anime’s opening video, considered as a component or derivative of the main work;</li>
            <li><b>indirect associations</b>, where objects were linked to related entities rather than to the primary
                item itself — for instance, Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries was connected through <i>The Poetic Edda</i>,
                a textual source relevant to the narrative universe of the anime.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <p>To reflect the variety inherent in cultural heritage, the selected objects included different types (or
            <b>Classes</b>) — such as a painting, a coin, a book, an audio recording, and a video — sourced from
            libraries, archives, museums (<b>LAMs</b>) and digital repositories. Each object was described using
            <b>metadata standards</b> suited to its format and institutional context [See here: <a
                href="#metadata">Metadata standards</a>].
        </p>
        <p>This approach enabled the integration of heterogeneous resources into a <b>coherent conceptual framework</b>,
            illustrating how multiple forms of relationship — narrative, structural, and thematic — can support the
            creation of a <b>unified dataset</b> across diverse domains.</p>
        <p>Our workflow began with two <b>concept maps</b> built from the work (in <b>FRBR</b> terms) <i>Vinland
                Saga</i>. Rather than linking this work directly to the items, we introduced <b>intermediate
                entities</b> — such as events, concepts, characters, and related works — to create a richer,
            multi-layered network. These entities are visually differentiated, as it can be seen in the legend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>events appear as grey rectangles</li>
            <li>concepts as cyan clouds</li>
            <li>characters as stylized figures</li>
            <li>related works as cyan circles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The predicates in this early stage mainly come from <b>CIDOC-CRM</b> (events) and <b>FRBROO</b> (people).
            When no suitable standard predicate was available, we defined new ones within our <b>VinLOD namespace</b> to
            maintain semantic consistency.</p>
        <p>To reflect different levels of abstraction from the <b>manifestation</b> to the <b>item</b>, we followed the
            <b>FRBR model</b>. For books and music — forms of art that can exist in multiple manifestations — we used an
            <b>idea-to-manifestation approach</b>: first connecting through the conceptual entity, then linking to the
            tangible, material object.
        </p>
        <p>The concept maps were created step by step: starting from an initial draft in natural language
            (<b>Theoretical Map</b>), then refined through research on each object and by studying how institutions had
            catalogued and described them through appropriate <b>metadata standards</b>. At this stage, we ensured
            compatibility and enriched the map (<b>Conceptual Map</b>) with additions and modifications, respecting the
            <b>domain and range requirements</b> of each predicate.
        </p>

        <h3 id="metadata">Metadata standards</h3>
        <p>The selection of <b>metadata standards</b> began by reviewing the websites hosting the objects we intended to
            include in our project. Wherever possible, we chose to implement the same standards adopted by the hosting
            institutions, while always considering the need for conversion into <b>RDF</b> and ensuring compatibility
            with the final data model.</p>
        <p>In cases where it was not possible to obtain metadata directly from institutional sources, or the standard
            was not suitable in a <b>LOD</b> perspective, we carried out additional research to determine the most
            appropriate standards for each specific type of item on our own.</p>
        <p>For the metadata retrieved from institutions, we downloaded and converted their files (all of them were
            <b>XML</b>) into RDF using Python, selectively extracting only the elements that aligned with our initial
            vision of the map and supplementing them when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>Where objects did not have metadata available for download, we manually created <b>CSV</b> files, which were
            then converted into RDF [See here: <a href="#fromtordf">From * to RDF</a>].</p>
        <p>Below is a detailed list of all the <b>metadata standards</b> adopted, their purpose, references to official
            documentation, and the specific objects to which they were applied, together with the rationale behind each
            choice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>LIDO/ NMO:</b> For the <i>coin</i> object, we chose to adopt the same metadata standard already
                    used by
                    the host institution, namely the <i>Münzkabinett</i> of Berlin. LIDO is an XML schema specifically
                    designed
                    for
                    describing cultural heritage objects and their metadata in a structured and hierarchical way. Its
                    primary
                    strength lies in defining which elements and sub-elements can be used and how they should be
                    ordered,
                    enabling rich, multilingual descriptions suitable for a wide range of cultural, artistic,
                    technological, and
                    natural science objects.</p>

                <p>The LIDO schema emerged from a substantial redesign of CDWA Lite and museumdat, incorporating
                    feedback from
                    the community and further analysis aligned with the CIDOC CRM model. It primarily builds on CDWA
                    while
                    adding concepts to meet SPECTRUM requirements. </p>
                <p>In practical terms, LIDO is particularly useful for
                    organizing the internal structure of metadata: it facilitates a nested, hierarchical classification
                    that
                    proceeds from more general categories to increasingly specific details. However, since it is an XML
                    schema,
                    it does not provide a semantic layer: it does not define the meaning of data in a
                    machine-interpretable way
                    as an ontology would, nor does it support RDF natively. XML-based schemas like LIDO, TEI, or METS
                    are
                    excellent for representing data with a coherent and
                    deeply
                    nested structure, using the tree model of XML. By contrast, RDF (Resource Description Framework)
                    expresses
                    data as a graph of triples (subject–predicate–object), which enables explicit semantic relationships
                    and
                    greater interoperability.</p>

                <p>For this reason, we complemented LIDO with the <b>Numismatic Ontology (NMO)</b>, which provides the
                    semantic
                    layer needed to describe the coin in RDF. Through NMO, we were able to add precise semantic
                    properties
                    regarding physical description, chronological attribution, provenance, and collection details, each
                    linked
                    to persistent identifiers. This combination allowed us to retain the structural richness of LIDO
                    while
                    enriching it with the semantic expressiveness and interoperability of RDF provided by NMO.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <b>MARC21</b> is a widely adopted metadata standard designed to store and exchange bibliographic
                    data about a broad range of materials: books, manuscripts, maps, music, digital resources, and more.
                    A MARC record consists of three main elements: the record structure (based on international
                    standards like ISO 2709), the <b>content designators</b> (tags, indicators, and subfield codes), and
                    the actual data content, which is typically defined by cataloging rules or controlled vocabularies
                    such as ISBD and LCSH. </p>
                <p> Although it has been fundamental for libraries for decades, <b>MARC21</b> has limitations when it
                    comes to the modern web. It relies on a <b>hierarchical, sequential XML model</b> that structures
                    data well but lacks explicit semantic meaning. Since it was not designed to work natively
                    with <b>RDF</b>, instead of describing our resources directly with MARC21 properties, it was
                    necessary the
                    use of <b>BIBFRAME</b>. <b>BIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework)</b> was created <b>specifically by the
                        Library of Congress (LOC)</b> to replace MARC21 and transition bibliographic metadata into the
                    paradigm of <b>Linked Open Data (LOD)</b>.</p>
                <p> <b>BIBFRAME</b> provides an RDF vocabulary made up of <b>classes and properties</b> that describe
                    resources
                    and express their connections. For example, it can express that one Work is a “translation of”
                    another Work, or that an Instance is a particular realization of a Work. This semantic richness
                    allows us to model bibliographic and cultural heritage data in a way that is interoperable and
                    compatible with other datasets on the web.
                </p>
                <p> We also partially used BIBFRAME to describe the <i>Ride of the Valkyries</i>, since
                    MARC21—and therefore BIBFRAME—is designed to handle not only bibliographic records but also sound
                    recordings. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <b>Dublin Core</b> (named after the city of Dublin, Ohio) is a widely used metadata standard built
                    around a basic set of elements designed to describe virtually any type of digital content—such as
                    videos, images, and web pages—as well as physical resources like books, CDs, and even artworks
                    shared over computer networks. </p>
                <p>The full name of the initiative is the <b>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
                        (DCMI)</b>, which emerged within the context of the <b>OCLC (Online Computer Library
                        Center)</b>, a major U.S.-based cooperative for library services. In March 1995, a conference
                    was held in Dublin, Ohio, bringing together a diverse group of librarians, archivists, publishers,
                    software developers, and representatives from working groups of the <b>Internet Engineering Task
                        Force (IETF)</b>. They shared a common goal: to define a standardized way to enhance discovery
                    and access to digital information. </p>
                <p> The idea was to establish a core set of descriptive elements that could be supplied directly by
                    content creators or publishers, embedded within digital objects themselves or linked externally.
                    This collective effort led to the design of a metadata architecture suited to the needs of content
                    producers, vendors, and users alike. </p>
                <p> Originally introduced in December 1996, the core set included fifteen
                    fundamental elements, which later evolved to support additional refinements and qualifiers while
                    retaining its straightforward structure. For Italian users, the official translation of version 1.1
                    of the “Dublin Core Metadata Element Set” has been overseen by the <b>ICCU (Central Institute for
                        the Union Catalogue of Italian Libraries and for Bibliographic Information)</b>. </p>
                <p>For this reason, we applied Dublin Core across multiple object types—such as manuscripts, audio
                    files, and paintings—because its metadata elements are quite broad and flexible, particularly when
                    describing the roles of creators as well as temporal and spatial properties. </p>
            <li>
                <p>Similarly, this is the case for <b>Schema.org</b>, a collaborative initiative launched in 2011 by
                    major search engines—Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex—to create a unified vocabulary for structured
                    data on the web. Its primary goal is to standardize how information about various types of content
                    is marked up in HTML, improving search engines’ ability to understand and present rich results.
                    Schema.org covers a broad range of categories, including creative works, events, organizations, and
                    more, making it highly adaptable for different domains.

                    Because of its wide adoption and flexibility, Schema.org is especially useful for describing
                    multimedia resources such as videos, images, paintings, and illustrations. It supports rich semantic
                    annotations that help connect content across the web, facilitating better discoverability and
                    interoperability. This versatility made it a natural choice for our project to describe diverse
                    object types consistently. We mostly used Schema for the objects that did not have the metadata
                    standard clearly specified or were taken from wikidata.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model</b> (CIDOC-CRM) is a comprehensive ontology developed to facilitate
                the integration, mediation, and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information. Originating
                from the International Council of Museums (ICOM), CIDOC-CRM provides a formal structure to represent
                cultural artifacts, their provenance, and the events surrounding their lifecycle, enabling museums,
                archives, and libraries to share data semantically and consistently. Its strength lies in modeling
                complex relationships between objects, actors, places, and times in a way that preserves the context and
                meaning of cultural heritage information. On the other hand, <b>FRBRoo</b> (Functional Requirements for
                Bibliographic Records – object oriented) is an ontology that merges the concepts of the FRBR model,
                widely used in bibliographic and library science, with CIDOC-CRM’s rich semantic framework. Developed
                collaboratively by the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group and the library community, FRBRoo extends
                CIDOC-CRM by specifically addressing bibliographic records, linking intellectual works, their
                expressions, manifestations, and items within the broader cultural heritage context. This integration
                allows for a unified, interoperable data model that supports detailed semantic descriptions of both
                tangible and intangible cultural heritage and bibliographic resources. The relationship between
                CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo thus bridges museum documentation and library cataloging, fostering cross-domain
                data exchange and enhancing the discoverability and reuse of cultural and bibliographic information on
                the semantic web. <p>As previously mentioned, we utilized these standards to link entities to objects
                    and to define the classes of the objects themselves. All objects have a corresponding CIDOC-CRM
                    class assigned through rdf:type.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="xmltei">XML/TEI and HTML documents</h3>
        <p>The <b>TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)</b> is a widely used <b>XML-based standard</b> developed to represent
            texts in digital form, particularly within the humanities. Its goal is to make textual resources not only
            digitally preservable but also richly describable and interoperable, so that they can be shared and studied
            across different platforms and research projects.</p>
        <p><b>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</b> is a flexible markup language designed to structure, store, and
            transport data. Unlike HTML, which focuses on presentation, XML focuses on the logical structure and meaning
            of the content, making it especially suitable for scholarly work that requires clear definitions of elements
            such as titles, names, places, and editorial interventions.</p>
        <p>For this project, we created two <b>XML/TEI files</b>, each dedicated to a different textual object:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A ballad taken from the Poetic Edda, translated by Henry Adams Bellows</li>
            <li>An excerpt from the manuscript Finding of Wineland</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each file includes a <b>teiHeader</b>, which holds the metadata describing the text. Beyond the mandatory
            parts — namely the <b>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</b> element (containing title, publication statement, and source
            description) — we also added an <b>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</b> section. Inside it, we included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A concise <b>&lt;projectDesc&gt;</b> outlining the purpose and scope of our work</li>
            <li>An <b>&lt;editorialDecl&gt;</b> detailing our editorial choices, including how we handled corrections,
                normalizations, hyphenation, and other interventions necessary to make the text clearer without losing
                fidelity to the source</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After encoding the texts in XML, we transformed them into <b>HTML</b> using <b>XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet
                Language Transformations)</b>. XSLT is a powerful language specifically created to process XML documents
            and convert them into other formats — most commonly HTML — which can then be displayed in a web browser.
            This transformation step is crucial because, while XML structures and preserves data, it isn’t meant to be
            read directly by end users. HTML, on the other hand, is designed for presentation: it structures text,
            links, images, and interactive elements so that the content can be easily navigated and read online.</p>
        <p>Special attention was given to entities we identified as central in our conceptual graph — people, places,
            and events. Whenever these appeared in the text, we marked them so they would become clickable. This
            approach supports interoperability, as these links can potentially connect to other datasets or resources,
            and it offers readers the possibility to explore related information if they wish.</p>
        <p>We also included notes, which are displayed interactively: by clicking on highlighted text, the user can see
            footnotes at the bottom of the page or open contextual notes in a side panel. This choice enriches the
            reading experience, balancing the scholarly depth of critical apparatus with usability and modern web
            standards.</p>
        <p>The transformation from XML to HTML was carried out in Python using the <b>lxml</b> library, which provides
            robust tools for parsing XML and applying XSLT stylesheets.</p>
        <p>In the script, the XML file and the XSLT stylesheet are first parsed; then, the transformation is performed
            by creating an <b>XSLT object</b> and applying it to the XML document. Finally, the result is serialized and
            written to an HTML file.</p>
        <p>Overall, by combining the descriptive power of XML and TEI with the flexibility of XSLT and the web-native
            format of HTML, our project aims to create digital editions that are both faithful to the original texts and
            engaging for contemporary readers.</p>

        <h3 id="textanalysis">Text Analysis</h3>
        <p>For the two texts, we first prepared a Python script to extract the text from the HTML files and save it into
            plain text <b>.txt files</b>, using the <b>etree library</b> for parsing and navigating the HTML structure.
            Once we had the plain text, we developed the main Python script for text analysis.</p>
        <p>This script defines a class called <b>TextAnalyzer</b>, designed to help explore and analyze text files
            through various natural language processing techniques. It uses popular libraries such as <b>NLTK</b> for
            basic text processing, <b>spaCy</b> for named entity recognition, <b>scikit-learn</b> for computing TF-IDF
            scores, and <b>VADER</b> for sentiment analysis.</p>
        <p>With this tool, you can load and clean your text by tokenizing it and removing common English stopwords and
            punctuation. You can then analyze word frequencies, extract frequent n-grams (such as bigrams), and detect
            meaningful collocations—pairs of words that appear together more often than by chance.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the class allows you to inspect how specific words are used in context via concordance views,
            identify key terms with TF-IDF weighting, recognize named entities like people or places, and perform
            sentiment analysis to gauge the overall emotional tone of the text.</p>
        <p>Using the <b>TextAnalyzer</b> is simple: after initializing it with the path to your text file, you call the
            <b>load_and_tokenize()</b> method to prepare the data. Then you can run any of the analysis methods as
            needed.
        </p>
        <p>This makes <b>TextAnalyzer</b> a flexible and effective tool for text mining, ideal for small to medium-sized
            corpora and for conducting exploratory textual analysis.</p>
        <p>Here is an example with the top 10 most common words in the <b>Poetic Edda</b>:</p>
        <table class="common-words">
            <thead>

                    <td>11</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>set</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>shall</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>agnar</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>king</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>men</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                </tr>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Although the corpus is relatively small (just over 1100 tokens), conducting a textual analysis proves
            invaluable for understanding the nature of the text. Notably, the most frequent token is the Saxon genitive
            apostrophe, which is naturally included among the terms due to its semantic significance—while all other
            punctuation marks have been filtered out as stopwords. This finding aligns well with the epic character of
            the work, where numerous names appear, typically presented within familial formulas such as ‘father of’ or
            ‘son of,’ a common feature in mythological narrative traditions.</p>
        <p>Let us now consider another example using the TF-IDF method:</p>
        <table class="tfidf-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Term</th>

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>’</td>
                    <td>0.1343</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>othin</td>
                    <td>0.1123</td>

        <p>According to the TF-IDF analysis, it is understandable that <i>othin</i> ranks second: as noted in the
            introduction to the transcription of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> on our website, his name holds a central place
            in the narrative because, as he himself states, the text is dense with his epithets which
            have been fully annotated in the <i>particDesc</i> due to their significance to the story.</p>
        <h3 id="fromtordf">From * to RDF</h3>
        <p>As previously said, the main objective and final step of the project was the transformation of heterogeneous
            data sources into <b>RDF format</b>. In the end, every object we worked on—whether stored in <b>CSV</b> or
            <b>XML</b>—was converted to RDF. This transformation was not just a technical requirement, but a way to
            semantically enrich and interconnect resources within a coherent <b>Linked Open Data framework</b>.
        </p>
        <p>In order to do so, we developed different <b>Python scripts</b> tailored to the specific format and structure
            of each input file.</p>
        <p>The transformation process always involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying a suitable <b>subject URI</b> for the resource.</li>
            <li>Mapping <b>predicates</b> according to established ontologies.</li>
            <li>Differentiating between <b>literals</b> and <b>resources</b>, with careful attention to domain and range
                compatibility.</li>
            <li>Enriching the graph with contextual information wherever available, including relationships with people,
                places, institutions, or time periods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the objects without downloadable metadata available—such as the anime opening video, the Wagner
            recording, the illustration, the painting, the manga, and the anime—we worked with metadata stored in <b>CSV
                format</b>. These files included rows predicates and objects to be associated with a given subject URI.
        </p>
        <p>The logic behind the transformation was modular: for each row, the script parsed the predicate (resolving it
            to a full URI through a prefix mapping) and determined whether the object should be treated as a <b>URI</b>
            or a <b>literal</b>. We also took care to bind all relevant namespaces to the RDF graph for readability and
            standardization.</p>
        <p>Other objects came with <b>XML metadata</b>, in various schemas—mainly <b>LIDO</b>, <b>MARC</b> and
            <b>TEI</b>. For these, we wrote scripts that navigated and parsed the XML structure, extracted relevant
            information, and mapped it to RDF triples.
        </p>
        <p>In the case of the two texts encoded in XML/TEI, we treated the TEI file itself as another manifestation of
            the work and extracted metadata primarily from the <b>TeiHeader</b>, emphasizing bibliographic and
            descriptive information about the digital edition and its context.</p>
        <p>All RDF graphs were serialized in <b>Turtle format</b>. This choice supported better readability and easier
            version control. The serialized files are structured to reflect the <b>subject–predicate–object</b> pattern
            clearly and allow further integration or querying via SPARQL endpoints.</p>
        <p>The main libraries and tools used included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>RDFlib</b> for building and serializing RDF graphs.</li>
            <li><b>pandas</b> for reading and manipulating CSV files.</li>
            <li><b>lxml</b> for parsing XML files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each script was customized for the input format and the type of object being described, but we maintained a
            shared structure and approach to ensure overall coherence.</p>
        <p>This data transformation phase played a crucial role in the project, not only enabling interoperability but
            also supporting a deeper reflection on metadata quality, structure, and meaning.</p>
        <p>The only Turtle file not generated through Python scripts was <b>VinLOD.ttl</b>.</p>
        <p>This file was written manually for its very specific purpose within the dataset: it acts as a bridge
            connecting the work—in this case, <b>Vinland Saga</b>—to the actual objects described in our RDF collection.
        </p>
        <p>In VinLOD.ttl, we defined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Classes</b> (e.g., Person, Event, Place) that represent core concepts of the narrative and historical
                universe.</li>
            <li><b>Properties</b> describing relationships between these entities (such as genealogical links,
                participation in historical events, or connections between narrative characters and real historical

        <p>Its aim was not simply to describe individual objects, but rather to establish a <b>semantic network</b> that
            connects the narrative world to historically documented people, places, events and, finally, their items.

        <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
        <p>This project demonstrates how transforming heterogeneous cultural heritage data into <b>RDF</b> is more than
            a purely technical exercise: it is a process of knowledge construction. By explicitly modelling
            relationships, contexts, and multiple layers of meaning, we shift from isolated descriptions to a rich
            semantic network that supports discovery, reuse, and long-term preservation.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the web itself has evolved in this direction. From a primarily document-centric system, it
            has become an ever-expanding constellation of interconnected data—what we call the <b>Semantic Web</b>.
            Graph structures now lie at the heart of this transformation: they are the underlying models that allow
            machines to interpret and connect disparate information, turning raw data into a navigable, contextualized
            body of knowledge.</p>
        <p>Major platforms and search engines—Google, Microsoft, and many others—have embraced this paradigm, building
            and querying vast knowledge graphs to enhance search, recommendation, and content understanding. The same
            logic applies to cultural heritage: by structuring data as linked graphs, we make objects and narratives not
            only visible but also meaningfully discoverable, both by people and by algorithms in the <b>LAM
                environment</b>.</p>
        <p>Through <b>VinLOD</b>, we aimed to show how a small, curated dataset—even one inspired by popular culture
            like <b>Vinland Saga</b>—can become part of this larger, interoperable web of knowledge. Our conceptual
            maps, metadata choices, and manual alignments to existing ontologies illustrate that cultural heritage is
            not just a collection of objects: it is a dynamic network of meanings, contexts, and interpretations that
            can keep evolving and connecting across time, space, and disciplines.</p>
        <p>In the end, the act of modelling and linking data is itself an act of storytelling: one that preserves the
            past, enriches the present, and opens new paths for future research, creativity, and shared understanding.

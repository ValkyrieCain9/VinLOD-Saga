                <h1>Grimnismol</h1>
                <h2><i>The Ballad of Grimnir</i></h2>
                <div><h4>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams_Bellows_(businessman)" target="_blank">Henry Adam Bellows</a>'<i> Poetic Edda</i>

                <div style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory note</div>
                 
                     
                        <p>The <i>Grimnismol</i> follows the<i>Vafthruthnismol</i> in the <i>Codex Regius</i> and is also found complete in 
                            the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, where also it follows the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. Snorri quotes over twenty of 
                            its stanzas.
                        </p>
                    
                    
                        <p>Like the preceding poem, the <i>Grimnismol</i> is largely encyclopædic in nature, and consists chiefly
                            of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five 
                            of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the 
                            catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Othin</a>, concealed 
                            under the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Grimnir</a>, is through an error tortured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">King Geirröth</a>. Bound between two 
                            blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king’s little son, Agnar, who 
                            has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true 
                            name, or rather names, to the terrified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed. 
                        </p>
                        
                     
                        <p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem 
                            itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose 
                            statement of the manner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>’s death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the 
                            Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably 
                            they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed 
                            such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in 
                            the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date 
                            many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.</p>
                    
                     
                        <p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, 
                            first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that 
                            all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers 
                            of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them 
                            followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose 
                            tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they 
                            contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The 
                            early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and in some 
                            of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose links between dialogue stanzas.
                        </p>
                    
                     
                        <p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless, for it 
                            suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called popular epic. 
                            It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence 
                            before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages 
                            before such a poem as the <i>Iliad</i>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems 
                            prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable 
                            amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.
                        </p>
                    
                     
                        <p>Interpolations in such a poem as the <i>Grimnismol</i> could have been made easily enough, and many 
                            stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are 
                            clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had 
                            when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.
                        </p>
                    
                
            </div>
        
             
                <div class="intro"> 
                         
                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hraudung" target="_blank">Hrauthung</a> had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>. 
                                Agnar was ten winters old, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a> eight. Once they both rowed in a boat 
                                with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the 
                                sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, 
                                they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The 
                                housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>, and taught 
                                him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple 
                                led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>. They had a fair 
                                wind, and came to their father’s landing-place. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a> was forward in the 
                                boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said,  Go thou now 
                                where evil may have thee! The boat drifted out to sea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>, however, 
                                went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a> was made king, and became a renowned man.
                            </p>
                        
                         
                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Othin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg" target="_blank">Frigg</a> sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Othin</a> said: 
                                  Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the 
                                cave? But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land. 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg" target="_blank">Frigg</a> said:  He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too 
                                many of them come to him. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Othin</a> replied that this was the greatest of lies; and
                                they made a wager about this matter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg" target="_blank">Frigg</a> sent her maid-servant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulla" target="_blank">Fulla</a>, to 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">Geirröth</a>. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his
                                land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so 
                                fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">King Geirröth</a> was 
                                not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Grimnir</a>, but said no more about himself, though he was questioned. The king had him 
                                tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there 
                                eight nights.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r" target="_blank">King Geirröth</a> had a son ten winters old, and called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnarr_Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson" target="_blank">Agnar</a> after his 
                                father’s brother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnarr_Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson" target="_blank">Agnar</a> went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Grimnir</a>, and gave him a full horn to drink from, 
                                and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented without cause. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Grimnir</a> 
                                drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" target="_blank">Grimnir</a>’s back. He spake:

            <div class="personal">
                <p>
                    This document was produced as part of the <a href="#">Text Encoding and Semantic Representation</a> examination, which required creating an XML/TEI-encoded version of a chosen text. To conceptually link ten selected items—more specifically a recording of Wagner’s <i>Ride of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a></i>—a literary reference to <a href="#VL">Valhalla</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a> was deliberately sought. The Poetic Edda was identified as the ideal source, being the most significant collection of mythological and heroic poetry in Old Norse tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Poetic Edda is the modern designation for a collection of anonymous Old Norse narrative poems written in alliterative verse. Separate from the related Prose Edda, it remains a cornerstone for the study of Old Norse literature. Among its various versions, the most significant is the medieval Icelandic manuscript known as the Codex Regius, which preserves 31 poems. These poems mainly adopt the fornyrðislag (“old story metre”), alongside the málaháttr (“speech form”), with about a quarter composed in ljóðaháttr (“song form”). Their language tends to be direct and unembellished, making use of kennings that are generally simpler and less intricate than those in skaldic poetry. Originally transmitted orally by poets and minstrels across generations, the poems lack named authors, though many reveal distinct stylistic traits that hint at individual creative voices. Despite scholarly efforts to identify possible authors, no definitive attribution has ever been established — leaving the Poetic Edda as a powerful testament to the shared and anonymous artistry of medieval Nordic tradition.
                </p>
                <p> The chosen text specifically focuses on Grímnismál (“The Sayings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Grimnir</a>”), a poem remarkable for its dense catalogue of names—of deities, beings, and places, both real and mythical—and its explicit references to <a href="#VL">Valhalla</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a> Preserved in the Codex Regius and the fragmentary AM 748 I 4to manuscript, it is spoken in the voice of Grímnir, one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a>’s many guises—a name itself meaning “hooded” or “masked.” The narrative recounts how King Geirröth, by mistake, tortured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a> in this disguise, ultimately bringing about his own death. Composed mostly in ljóðaháttr, Grímnismál is characteristic of wisdom poetry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The text presented here is an excerpt from the English translation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams_Bellows_(businessman)">Henry Adam Bellows</a>—a newspaper editor and early commissioner of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission—published as part of the “Scandinavian Classics” series for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, an institution dedicated to cultural exchange between the United States and Northern Europe. This translation was later transcribed and released as an eBook by Project Gutenberg, which served as the primary source for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The XML transcription aimed to be as faithful as possible, retaining special characters, text structure, page layout, and the original use of italics. All words and letters were transcribed verbatim without normalization, since the text had already been modernized from Old Norse to an archaizing form of English by the translator. Spacing was standardized to single spaces. Entities physically present in the narrative were annotated, while others merely mentioned were generally excluded—except for references essential to the project’s RDF graph construction, specifically <a href="#VL">Valhalla</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the poem, orthographic segmentation was applied, marking individual lines and stanzas, each sequentially numbered. All punctuation from the source text has been preserved. Hyphenation at line breaks was not altered.
                    Only annotations directly relevant to <a href="#VL">Valhalla</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a> were included, as they aligned with the conceptual aims of the project. Additional editorial notes, largely redundant, were omitted. The translator provided little commentary on manuscript variation; consequently, no witness list was included, as there were no significant variants to document. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Names and epithets of the characters on stage (except where they referred to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a>) — especially those connected to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a>, who alone is attributed with around fifty epithets, many of which appear in stanza 48 — were encoded through dedicated attributes. As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie">Valkyries</a> are mentioned but never directly appear in the narrative, they were encoded collectively to highlight their symbolic role rather than as individual figures. Proper names were retained in HTML to remain clickable and linkable to dedicated pages, while the layout was generated with XSL and the XML-to-HTML transformation carried out in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is especially compelling about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams_Bellows_(businessman)">Bellows</a>’ translation is his deliberate choice of archaic English: an attempt to echo the cadence and distant resonance of Old Norse, reviving its solemnity for modern readers. Through careful encoding and thoughtful interpretation, this edition seeks to preserve not only the text itself, but the spirit that still breathes through its ancient lines.

                        <p>The <i>Grimnismol</i> follows the<i>Vafthruthnismol</i> in the <i>Codex Regius</i> and is also found complete in 
                            the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, where also it follows the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. Snorri quotes over twenty of 
                            its stanzas.
                        </p>
                    
                    
                        <p>Like the preceding poem, the <i>Grimnismol</i> is largely encyclopædic in nature, and consists chiefly
                            of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five 
                            of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the 
                            catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Othin</a>, concealed 
                            under the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Grimnir</a>, is through an error tortured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">King Geirröth</a>. Bound between two 
                            blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king’s little son, Agnar, who 
                            has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true 
                            name, or rather names, to the terrified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed. 
                        </p>
                        
                     
                        <p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem 
                            itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose 
                            statement of the manner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>’s death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the 
                            Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably 
                            they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed 
                            such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in 
                            the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date 
                            many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.</p>
                    
                     
                        <p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, 
                            first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that 
                            all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers 
                            of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them 
                            followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose 
                            tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they 
                            contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The 
                            early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and in some 
                            of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose "links" between dialogue stanzas.
                        </p>
                    
                     
                        <p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless, for it 
                            suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called "popular" epic. 
                            It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence 
                            before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages 
                            before such a poem as the <i>Iliad</i>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems 
                            prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable 
                            amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.
                        </p>
                    
                     
                        <p>Interpolations in such a poem as the <i>Grimnismol</i> could have been made easily enough, and many 
                            stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are 
                            clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had 
                            when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.

                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hraudung">Hrauthung</a> had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>. 
                                Agnar was ten winters old, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a> eight. Once they both rowed in a boat 
                                with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the 
                                sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, 
                                they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The 
                                housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>, and taught 
                                him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple 
                                led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>. They had a fair 
                                wind, and came to their father’s landing-place. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a> was forward in the 
                                boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said,  "Go thou now 
                                where evil may have thee!" The boat drifted out to sea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>, however, 
                                went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a> was made king, and became a renowned man.

                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Othin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg">Frigg</a> sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Othin</a> said: 
                                 " Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the 
                                cave? But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land." 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg">Frigg</a> said: " He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too 
                                many of them come to him." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Othin</a> replied that this was the greatest of lies; and
                                they made a wager about this matter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg">Frigg</a> sent her maid-servant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulla">Fulla</a>, to 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Geirröth</a>. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his
                                land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so 
                                fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">King Geirröth</a> was 
                                not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Grimnir</a>, but said no more about himself, though he was questioned. The king had him 
                                tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there 
                                eight nights.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0r">King Geirröth</a> had a son ten winters old, and called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnarr_Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson">Agnar</a> after his 
                                father’s brother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnarr_Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson">Agnar</a> went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Grimnir</a>, and gave him a full horn to drink from, 
                                and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented without cause. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Grimnir</a> 
                                drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on
